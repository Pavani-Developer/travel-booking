# Travel Booking App
A travel booking web application built with SvelteKit and TypeScript. This app allows users to browse various travel packages, filter them, view detailed information, and book their trips.

Search functionality: Filter travel packages by destination or other criteria.
*Booking*: Users can fill out a booking form with personal details, travel dates, and number of travelers.
*Responsive design*: The app is fully responsive and works across all device sizes.
*Deployment-ready*: The app is ready for deployment to Netlify or any other hosting platform.
Technologies Used
*SvelteKit*: A modern framework for building fast, static, and dynamic websites and apps with Svelte.
*TypeScript*: Superset of JavaScript to improve development with static typing.
*Tailwind CSS*: A utility-first CSS framework to style the app with responsive and modern design.
*Netlify*: For deployment (configured with _redirects file to fix page refresh issues).
Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Install Dependencies
Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:


npm install
or

yarn install
1. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:


npm run dev
or


yarn dev
This will start the app locally, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
To deploy this app on Netlify:

Create a new site on Netlify and connect it to your GitHub repository.

Ensure you have a svelte.config.js configured with the appropriate adapter for deployment.

Create a _redirects file in the static/ folder to handle the routing issue on page refreshes. Add this line:

Edit
/*    /index.html   200
Push your changes to GitHub, and Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site.
