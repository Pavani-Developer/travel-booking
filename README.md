# Travel Booking App

A travel booking web application built with SvelteKit and TypeScript. This app allows users to browse various travel packages, filter them, view detailed information, and book their trips.

## Features
- **Browse travel packages**: View available travel packages with images, descriptions, prices, and durations.
- **Search functionality**: Filter travel packages by destination or other criteria.
- **Booking**: Users can fill out a booking form with personal details, travel dates, and number of travelers.
- **Responsive design**: The app is fully responsive and works across all device sizes.
- **Deployment-ready**: The app is ready for deployment to Netlify or any other hosting platform.

## Technologies Used
- **SvelteKit**: A modern framework for building fast, static, and dynamic websites and apps with Svelte.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript to improve development with static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to style the app with responsive and modern design.
- **Netlify**: For deployment (configured with `_redirects` file to fix page refresh issues).

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
or

```bash

yarn install
```
### 3. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start the app locally, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment
### To deploy this app on Netlify:
Create a new site on Netlify and connect it to your GitHub repository.
Ensure you have a svelte.config.js configured with the appropriate adapter for deployment.
Create a _redirects file in the static/ folder to handle the routing issue on page refreshes. Add this line:
```bash
/*    /index.html   200
```
Push your changes to GitHub, and Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site.

## File Structure
```pgsql
/src
  /lib
    /data          - Contains static or mock data used in the app (e.g., travelPackages.ts)
    /stores         - Contains Svelte stores for managing application state (e.g., travelStore.ts)
  /routes
    /booking/[id]  - Dynamic route for viewing specific booking details (e.g., /booking/1)
    /packages/[id] - Dynamic route for viewing specific package details (e.g., /packages/1)
    /+layout.svelte - Global layout wrapper for the app, used for header, footer, etc.
    /+page.svelte   - Home page of the app displaying a list of travel packages
    /Header.svelte  - Reusable component for the site's header with navigation and branding
/static
  - Static assets such as images, fonts, and the _redirects file
/svelte.config.js    - SvelteKit configuration file
/package.json       - Project metadata and dependencies
/tsconfig.json      - TypeScript configuration file
/.gitignore         - Gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control
unnecessary files from version control
```

# Key Points of the Structure:

- **Modularization**: You've broken down your app into small, reusable pieces such as components (e.g., Header.svelte), pages (e.g., +page.svelte), and state management (e.g., travelStore.ts).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Your data, stores, and UI components are separated, making it easier to maintain and scale the app.
- **Routing**: You're utilizing dynamic routing (e.g., booking/[id] and packages/[id]), allowing the app to display details for individual packages and bookings based on the id provided in the URL.
  
# Example Flow:

- The home page (+page.svelte) will display a list of travel packages by pulling data from travelPackages.ts.
- Clicking on a package will navigate to the packages/[id]/+page.svelte, where the specific package's details will be displayed.
- If users want to book a package, they will navigate to booking/[id]/+page.svelte and fill out a booking form.
- This structure is clean, and following this approach will make it easy to extend this app in the future if you decide to add more features like authentication, more complex state management, or additional pages.
